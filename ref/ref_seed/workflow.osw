Space type and loop details come from the OpenStudio model. The code for this is modular, making it easy to use as a template for your own custom reports. The structure of the report uses bootstrap, and the graphs use dimple js. The new measure warning section will show warnings generated by upstream measures. It will not show forward translation warnings, EnergyPlus warnings, or warnings that might be reported by this measure.",
